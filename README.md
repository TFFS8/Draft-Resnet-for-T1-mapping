# Draft-Resnet-for-T1-mapping

Draft Resnet to improve the fitting and resolution of T1 maps. 

The input of the Resnet is the saturation time images and the output is the 3 default maps of T1 saturation recovery fitting (T1, M0 and saturation efficiency).
- Input: Low resolution saturation time images.
- Output: High-resolution default maps of T1.
